## Papers Submitted and Under Review

* [1] **On the Mechanisms of Ability Peer Effects**, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsalamanca/home" target="_blank">Nicolás Salamanca</a>.\

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Studying with higher ability peers increases student performance, yet we have little idea why. We exploit mandated random assignment of students to classrooms and find positive peer effects on test scores. With rich data on nineteen potential mechanisms, we then estimate how effects on attitudes, parents, and teachers could drive these results. Higher-achieving peers reduce student effort, increase student university aspirations, increase parental time investments and parental strictness, and have precise null effects elsewhere. None of these mechanisms, however, explain our peer effect on test scores. Our novel method to detect cluster violations of random assignment is of independent interest.</p>

* [2] **Child Health and Parental Responses to an Unconditional Cash Transfer at Birth**, with John Lynch, Aurélie Meunier, Rhiannon Pilkington, and <a href="http://www.stefanie-schurer.com" target="_blank">Stefanie Schurer</a>.\

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We estimate the impact on child health of the unanticipated introduction of the Australian Baby Bonus, a \$3,000 one-off unconditional cash transfer at birth. Using regression discontinuity methods and linked administrative data from South Australia, we find that treated babies had fewer preventable, acute, and urgent hospital presentations—medical care available without co-payments—in the first two years of life. The payment later increased demand for elective care, which requires planning, medical referrals, and often co-payments. Our effects are strongest for disadvantaged families. Our findings suggest that up to 34\% of the payout were recouped within the first year.</p>

* [3] **From Subsidies to Loans: The Effects of a National Student Finance Reform on the Choices of Secondary School Students**, with <a href="https://www.jankabatek.com" target="_blank">Jan Kabátek</a>.\

<!-- mobile code --> 
<details class="collapse-abstract">
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We analyse the effects of a national student finance reform in the Netherlands, which replaced universal subsidies for higher education students by low-interest loans. We show that this reform had a large impact on education choices of secondary school students, lowering their enrolments in college-preparing tracks and increasing the share of students specializing in STEM subjects. The reform also affected the living arrangements of new college entrants. Our findings highlight that secondary school students respond to the modes of higher education financing well ahead of their graduation, and that financial aid uncertainty alone can deter many from pursuing higher education.</p>

* [4] **Two Decades of Welfare Reforms in Australia: How Did They Affect Single Mothers and Their Children?**, with <a href="http://www.stefanie-schurer.com" target="_blank">Stefanie Schurer</a> and Angela Zhang.\

<details class="collapse-abstract">
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Worldwide, single mothers are profoundly time and income constrained, making them heavily reliant on government transfers. We examine how welfare reforms that introduced mutual obligations affected the economic position of single mothers and the development of their children over the past two decades in Australia. Using nationally representative longitudinal data, we show that disposable incomes of single-mother households were significantly reduced relative to partnered mothers since the 2005 Welfare-to-Work Act came into effect in July 2006, a downward trend that was aggravated by the Global Financial Crisis and the 2013 suspension of grandfathered single parenting payment rules. The reform diminished parenting and family payments for single mothers, who compensated income loss by increasing reliance on disability pension payments, work hours, and child-care expenditures. We then use nationally representative cohort data to estimate the impact of single motherhood on child skill development, following children who entered primary school when their mothers were affected by the Welfare-to-Work reform. We find unadjusted single-motherhood gaps of 0.2 SD in cognitive and 0.3 SD in non-cognitive skills. Non-cognitive skill gaps are only partially explained by differences in observable characteristics, while cognitive skill gaps are fully explained by observable characteristics. Differences in disposable household income between single and partnered mother households explain over 50% of the observed cognitive ability gaps in childhood and 25% in late adolescence. In the presence of positive spillover effects, we propose that welfare payments to vulnerable families may function as a social investment rather than a sunk cost.</p>

* [1] **Class Rank and Sibling Spillover Effects**.

<!-- mobile code --> 
<details class="collapse-abstract">
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This paper studies how students' relative rank affects their younger siblings’ academic performance. Using Dutch administrative data, I exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in student rank. Consistent with previous research, I find that higher-ranked students experience faster human capital accumulation. Yet, these rank effects generate negative spillovers on younger siblings: a one standard deviation increase in rank decreases younger sibling’s test scores by 2 percent of a standard deviation. These spillovers are stronger for same-sex siblings. I show that changes in parental investments and expectations drive part of these spillovers. In particular, I show that migrant parents increase investments in school quality and speaking Dutch at home. My findings highlight that the peer environment creates within-family human capital spillovers.</p>

* [2] **Do Same-Sex Teachers Affect Test Scores and Job Preferences? A Super-Study and a Meta-Analysis on Role Model Effects in Education**, with <a href="https://janfeld.weebly.com" target="_blank">Jan Feld</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsalamanca/home" target="_blank">Nicolás Salamanca</a> and <a href="http://ulfzoelitz.com" target="_blank">Ulf Zölitz</a>.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Previous studies provide contradicting evidence on same-sex role model effects in education. We resolve those contradictions with a meta-analysis and a super-study. Our meta-analysis summarizes 25 studies, and our super-study provides new evidence from 86 countries and 3.8 million students. Both approaches highlight that role model effects on students’ performance are small: 0.036 SD in the meta-analysis and 0.015 SD in the super-study. Moving beyond test scores our super-study documents larger role model effects of 0.063 SD on job preferences, which are concentrated in rich and gender-equal countries. Our results suggest that same-sex role models do not close performance gaps but may help reduce occupational segregation.</p>

  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>We propose a simple methodology based on a microeconomic model of human capital investment with goals and using threshold regression methods to estimate the size and location in the population of aspirational poverty traps. We apply our methodology to the United States using the NLSY79 and find that 5.5 to 7% of the population, around the 37th percentile of wealth, could be located in such poverty traps.</p>
