<p>
Studying with higher ability peers increases student performance, yet we
have little idea why. We exploit mandated random assignment of students
to classrooms and find positive peer effects on test scores. With rich
data on nineteen potential mechanisms, we then estimate how effects on
attitudes, parents, and teachers could drive these results.
Higher-achieving peers reduce student effort, increase student
university aspirations, increase parental time investments and parental
strictness, and have precise null effects elsewhere. None of these
mechanisms, however, explain our peer effect on test scores. Our novel
method to detect cluster violations of random assignment is of
independent interest.

We estimate the impact on child health of the unanticipated introduction
of the Australian Baby Bonus, a $3,000 one-off unconditional cash
transfer at birth. Using regression discontinuity methods and linked
administrative data from South Australia, we find that treated babies
had fewer preventable, acute, and urgent hospital presentations—medical
care available without co-payments—in the first two years of life. The
payment later increased demand for elective care, which requires
planning, medical referrals, and often co-payments. Our effects are
strongest for disadvantaged families. Our findings suggest that up to
34% of the payout were recouped within the first year.

We analyse the effects of a national student finance reform in the
Netherlands, which replaced universal subsidies for higher education
students by low-interest loans. We show that this reform had a large
impact on education choices of secondary school students, lowering their
enrolments in college-preparing tracks and increasing the share of
students specializing in STEM subjects. The reform also affected the
living arrangements of new college entrants. Our findings highlight that
secondary school students respond to the modes of higher education
financing well ahead of their graduation, and that financial aid
uncertainty alone can deter many from pursuing higher education.

Abstract

<p>
Worldwide, single mothers are profoundly time and income constrained,
making them heavily reliant on government transfers. We examine how
welfare reforms that introduced mutual obligations affected the economic
position of single mothers and the development of their children over
the past two decades in Australia. Using nationally representative
longitudinal data, we show that disposable incomes of single-mother
households were significantly reduced relative to partnered mothers
since the 2005 Welfare-to-Work Act came into effect in July 2006, a
downward trend that was aggravated by the Global Financial Crisis and
the 2013 suspension of grandfathered single parenting payment rules. The
reform diminished parenting and family payments for single mothers, who
compensated income loss by increasing reliance on disability pension
payments, work hours, and child-care expenditures. We then use
nationally representative cohort data to estimate the impact of single
motherhood on child skill development, following children who entered
primary school when their mothers were affected by the Welfare-to-Work
reform. We find unadjusted single-motherhood gaps of 0.2 SD in cognitive
and 0.3 SD in non-cognitive skills. Non-cognitive skill gaps are only
partially explained by differences in observable characteristics, while
cognitive skill gaps are fully explained by observable characteristics.
Differences in disposable household income between single and partnered
mother households explain over 50% of the observed cognitive ability
gaps in childhood and 25% in late adolescence. In the presence of
positive spillover effects, we propose that welfare payments to
vulnerable families may function as a social investment rather than a
sunk cost.

Abstract

<p>
This paper studies how students’ relative rank affects their younger
siblings’ academic performance. Using Dutch administrative data, I
exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in student rank.
Consistent with previous research, I find that higher-ranked students
experience faster human capital accumulation. Yet, these rank effects
generate negative spillovers on younger siblings: a one standard
deviation increase in rank decreases younger sibling’s test scores by 2
percent of a standard deviation. These spillovers are stronger for
same-sex siblings. I show that changes in parental investments and
expectations drive part of these spillovers. In particular, I show that
migrant parents increase investments in school quality and speaking
Dutch at home. My findings highlight that the peer environment creates
within-family human capital spillovers.

Previous studies provide contradicting evidence on same-sex role model
effects in education. We resolve those contradictions with a
meta-analysis and a super-study. Our meta-analysis summarizes 25
studies, and our super-study provides new evidence from 86 countries and
3.8 million students. Both approaches highlight that role model effects
on students’ performance are small: 0.036 SD in the meta-analysis and
0.015 SD in the super-study. Moving beyond test scores our super-study
documents larger role model effects of 0.063 SD on job preferences,
which are concentrated in rich and gender-equal countries. Our results
suggest that same-sex role models do not close performance gaps but may
help reduce occupational segregation.

The integration of ethnic minority students in the classroom could
change the behavior of students, parents and teachers of ethnic
majorities. Using random assignment of children to classrooms in
Taiwanese middle schools, we show that exposure to Indigenous but not
Hakka minorities lowers test scores of ethnic majority students. These
negative effects are primarily due to endogenous responses of parents
and teachers rather than of students. We conclude that parental and
teacher behavioral adjustments rather than direct exposure to minority
children are plausible explanations behind the observed negative effects
of classroom exposure to Indigenous students.

  <p>We propose a simple methodology based on a microeconomic model of human capital investment with goals and using threshold regression methods to estimate the size and location in the population of aspirational poverty traps. We apply our methodology to the United States using the NLSY79 and find that 5.5 to 7% of the population, around the 37th percentile of wealth, could be located in such poverty traps.</p>
