<p>
Studying with higher ability peers increases student achievement, yet we
have little idea why. To address this question, we use rich data on
students, parents, teachers and school administrators in a setting with
mandated random assignment of students to classrooms within schools.
Some schools do not comply with this mandate. We develop a novel method
to detect cluster violations of random assignment and show its
effectiveness to recover a valid quasi-experiment. Our results show
positive peer effects on test scores and precisely estimated null
effects on 18 potential mechanisms, many of which have been hypothesized
but never tested.

<p>
We estimate the impact on child health of the unanticipated introduction
of the Australian Baby Bonus, a $3,000 one-off unconditional cash
transfer at birth. Using regression discontinuity methods and linked
administrative data from South Australia, we find that treated babies
had fewer preventable, acute, and urgent hospital presentations—medical
care available without co-payments—in the first two years of life. The
payment later increased demand for elective care, which requires
planning, medical referrals, and often co-payments. Our effects are
strongest for disadvantaged families. Our findings suggest that up to
34% of the payout were recouped within the first year.

Abstract

<p>
We study same-sex role model effects of teachers with a meta-analysis
and our own study of three million students in 90 countries. Both
approaches show that role model effects on performance are, on average,
small: 0.030 SD in the meta-analysis and 0.015 SD in our multi-country
study. Going beyond test scores, our multi-country study documents
larger average role model effects on job preferences (0.063 SD). To
understand the universality of these effects, we estimate the
distributions of country-level same-sex role model effects. Although
role model effects on test scores appear universally small, we find
substantial cross-country variation for job preferences, with larger
effects in countries with larger gender gaps. These results are
consistent with role models inspiring students to overcome gender
stereotypes and pursue a STEM career. However, in countries with
negligible gender gaps, role models do not seem to have this equalizing
function.

We analyse the effects of a national student finance reform in the
Netherlands, which replaced universal subsidies for higher education
students by low-interest loans. We show that this reform had a large
impact on education choices of secondary school students, lowering their
enrolments in college-preparing tracks and increasing the share of
students specializing in STEM subjects. The reform also affected the
living arrangements of new college entrants. Our findings highlight that
secondary school students respond to the modes of higher education
financing well ahead of their graduation, and that financial aid
uncertainty alone can deter many from pursuing higher education.

Abstract

<p>
Worldwide, single mothers are profoundly time and income constrained,
making them heavily reliant on government transfers. We examine how
welfare reforms that introduced mutual obligations affected the economic
position of single mothers and the development of their children over
the past two decades in Australia. Using nationally representative
longitudinal data, we show that disposable incomes of single-mother
households were significantly reduced relative to partnered mothers
since the 2005 Welfare-to-Work Act came into effect in July 2006, a
downward trend that was aggravated by the Global Financial Crisis and
the 2013 suspension of grandfathered single parenting payment rules. The
reform diminished parenting and family payments for single mothers, who
compensated income loss by increasing reliance on disability pension
payments, work hours, and child-care expenditures. We then use
nationally representative cohort data to estimate the impact of single
motherhood on child skill development, following children who entered
primary school when their mothers were affected by the Welfare-to-Work
reform. We find unadjusted single-motherhood gaps of 0.2 SD in cognitive
and 0.3 SD in non-cognitive skills. Non-cognitive skill gaps are only
partially explained by differences in observable characteristics, while
cognitive skill gaps are fully explained by observable characteristics.
Differences in disposable household income between single and partnered
mother households explain over 50% of the observed cognitive ability
gaps in childhood and 25% in late adolescence. In the presence of
positive spillover effects, we propose that welfare payments to
vulnerable families may function as a social investment rather than a
sunk cost.

Abstract

<p>
This paper studies how students’ relative rank affects their younger
siblings’ academic performance. Using Dutch administrative data, I
exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in student rank.
Consistent with previous research, I find that higher-ranked students
experience faster human capital accumulation. Yet, these rank effects
generate negative spillovers on younger siblings: a one standard
deviation increase in rank decreases younger sibling’s test scores by 2
percent of a standard deviation. These spillovers are stronger for
same-sex siblings. I show that changes in parental investments and
expectations drive part of these spillovers. In particular, I show that
migrant parents increase investments in school quality and speaking
Dutch at home. My findings highlight that the peer environment creates
within-family human capital spillovers.

We develop and empirically test a theory of integration of minorities in
the classroom that incorporates endogenous responses of majority
students, their parents, and teachers in these classrooms. Using a
unique policy that randomly assigns children to classrooms in Taiwanese
middle schools and rich survey data, we show that exposure to Indigenous
students lowers the test scores of the majority students. These negative
effects are primarily due to the aforementioned endogenous responses
rather than direct peer effects. Our theory and results highlights the
limitations of the reduced-form interpretation of commonly used
linear-in-means peer effect models.

We estimate the impact of income-based priority points on children’s’
outcomes and parental choices from preschool to Grade 6. With
administrative records from Madrid, we use two sharp discontinuities in
household income per capita which determine income-based priority points
within the Boston mechanism. We first show that income-based priority
points change parents’ strategy: low-income parents apply to fewer
closer schools and schools with lower absenteeism, while higher-income
parents apply to more demanded and higher-scoring schools. The priority
points increase the likelihood that children are admitted to their
preferred school. Yet, we find economically insignificant effects on
standardized test scores 6 years later. Lastly, using a matched survey
of parents and children, we find small negative effects on parental and
child satisfaction with the school, teachers and peers. Our findings
indicate that low and higher-income parents respond in sophisticated but
different ways to priority rules under the Boston Mechanism.

Abstract

<p>
This paper studies how teachers respond to smaller classes and how these
responses impact student achievement in the Region of Madrid (Spain), a
region of over 1 million school-aged children and 3,000 schools. We
exploit the maximum class size rule that generates sharp discontinuities
in the relationship between school enrollment and average class size. We
estimate the impact of class size reductions on teacher responses and
student test scores using regression discontinuity models. We link data
covering three key elements at the classroom level: administrative data
on student enrollments, administrative data on student test scores and
information on teacher responses from teacher survey data covering the
universe of teachers and containing rich information on their classroom
activities. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that explain how
class size reductions can enhance student learning.

  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>We propose a simple methodology based on a microeconomic model of human capital investment with goals and using threshold regression methods to estimate the size and location in the population of aspirational poverty traps. We apply our methodology to the United States using the NLSY79 and find that 5.5 to 7% of the population, around the 37th percentile of wealth, could be located in such poverty traps.</p>
