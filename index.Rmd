I am a 2022 McKenzie Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <a href="https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/economics" target="_blank">the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne</a>.\ 

I am an economist interested in **education economics** and **applied micro-econometrics**. I study natural experiments using observational data and administrative records, to understand the **causes and consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage in the formation of human capital**. I investigate how children's educational outcomes are shaped by **families responding** to their **social environment in education** (e.g. teachers, peers) and to **welfare policies**.\  

Before joining the University of Melbourne, I was a postdoctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/schools/school-of-economics.html" target="_blank">the University of Sydney</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Maastricht University in the Netherlands in March 2021, where I was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliviermarie/" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Marie</a>. I hold a M.Sc. degree in Statistics from <a href="http://ensai.fr/en/" target="_blank">Ensai</a> in France, and a M.Sc. in Economics from <a href="https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/mainpage" target="_blank">Humboldt University</a> in Germany.\

I am also a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.iza.org" target="_blank">IZA Institute of Labor Economics</a>  since July 2018, and a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.lifecoursecentre.org.au" target="_blank">ARC Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course (LCC)</a> since May 2018. \

I exploit natural experiments, and analyze complex survey data and large-scale administrative records from the Netherlands, Taiwan, Spain, and Australia using applied econometric methods for causal inference. Another theme of my research focuses on empirical issues arising with natural experiments and observational data, such as identifying partial non-compliance to cluster treatment assignment in natural experiments or aggregating estimates across studies.
