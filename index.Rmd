I am an academic economist interested in human capital formation and applied micro-econometrics. My research focuses on how children and their parents interact with the school system, and how these interactions contribute to socioeconomic disadvantage. I use administrative data and survey data from various settings, and quasi-experimental methods.\  

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Maastricht University in the Netherlands in March 2021, where I was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliviermarie/" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Marie</a>. Before my PhD, I received a M.Sc. degree in Statistics from <a href="http://ensai.fr/en/" target="_blank">Ensai</a> in France, and a dual M.Sc. in Economics from <a href="https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/mainpage" target="_blank">Humboldt University</a> in Germany.\ 

I am currently a postdoctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/schools/school-of-economics.html" target="_blank">the University of Sydney</a>, where I work with <a href="http://www.stefanie-schurer.com" target="_blank">Prof. Stefanie Schurer</a>.\ 

During my PhD, I have visited the <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/home#home" target="_blank">Melbourne Institute</a> at The University of Melbourne from March 2018 to March 2019, <a href="https://www.iza.org" target="_blank">IZA</a> in April 2019, and the <a href="https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank">Jacobs Centre</a> and the Department of Economics at the University of Zurich from May to October 2019.\  

I am a Research Affiliate at IZA since July 2018, and a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.lifecoursecentre.org.au" target="_blank">ARC Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course (LCC)</a> since May 2018.
