I am an economist interested in the **economics of education** and **applied econometrics**. My research focuses broadly on the **causes and consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage in education**, especially on **parental engagement** and **social interactions in schools**. I apply econometrics methods for causal inference and policy evaluation. I also develop econometric procedures to address empirical issues such as cluster randomization failure in natural experiments. I use large-scale administrative records and survey data from Australia, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.\
