I am an academic economist interested in the **economics of education** and **applied micro-econometrics**. My research focuses broadly on the **causes and consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage in education**, especially on **parental engagement** and **social interactions in schools**. In my research I develop and apply econometrics procedures for causal inference and policy evaluation. I use these methods in my research with administrative and survey data from Australia, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.\  

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Maastricht University in the Netherlands in March 2021, where I was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliviermarie/" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Marie</a>.
