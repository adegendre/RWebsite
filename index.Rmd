I am currently a postdoctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/schools/school-of-economics.html" target="_blank">the University of Sydney</a>. From early 2022, I will be joining <a href="https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/economics" target="_blank">the Department of Economics</a> at <a href="https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au" target="_blank">the University of Melbourne</a> as McKenzie Research Fellow.\ 

I am an economist interested in **labor economics** and **applied econometrics**. My research explores the **causes and consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage in human capital formation**. I investigate how **families respond** to their **social environment in education** and to **welfare policies**, and how these responses affect educational outcomes and socioeconomic disadvantage. I exploit natural experiments, and analyze complex survey data and large-scale administrative records from the Netherlands, Taiwan, Spain, and Australia using applied econometric methods for causal inference. Another theme of my research focuses on empirical issues arising with natural experiments and observational data, such as identifying partial non-compliance to cluster treatment assignment in natural experiments or aggregating estimates across studies.\  

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Maastricht University in the Netherlands in March 2021, where I was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliviermarie/" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Marie</a>. Before my PhD, I received a M.Sc. degree in Statistics from <a href="http://ensai.fr/en/" target="_blank">Ensai</a> in France, and a dual M.Sc. in Economics from <a href="https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/mainpage" target="_blank">Humboldt University</a> in Germany.\

I am also a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.iza.org" target="_blank">IZA Institute of Labor Economics</a>  since July 2018, and a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.lifecoursecentre.org.au" target="_blank">ARC Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course (LCC)</a> since May 2018.\ 

During my PhD, I have visited the <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/home#home" target="_blank">Melbourne Institute</a> at the University of Melbourne from March 2018 to March 2019, the <a href="https://www.iza.org" target="_blank">IZA Institute of Labor Economics</a> in April 2019, and the <a href="https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank">Jacobs Centre</a> and the Department of Economics at the University of Zurich from May to October 2019.\
